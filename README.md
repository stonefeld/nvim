# Neovim

My setup of `nvim` written in `lua`.

## Dependencies

* `node` and `npm`
* `python` with `pip` and `python-venv` packages installed
* `tar`, `curl` and/or `git`
* A **C** compiler and `libstdc++`
* `fd` and `ripgrep`

## Installation

Simply clone the repository into your neovim config folder:

```bash
# For Linux/MacOS users
git clone https://github.com/stonefeld/nvim ~/.config/nvim

# For Windows users
git clone https://github.com/stonefeld/nvim C:/Users/<user>/AppData/Local/nvim
```

Once neovim is launched after cloning the repo, all plugins and tools will start downloading.
